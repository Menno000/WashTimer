# WashTimer  
The wash timer is a timer for kids to give them a visual cue on how long to brush their teeth and wash their hands.  

## Overview  
The wash timer is based around the MSP430g2452 MCU. It has two timers one for brushing teeth and one for washing hands. Depending on what the child wants to do they pick that timer and start it. Upon completion the timer 
turns on a green LED indicating that the child is free to be done. The actual hardware for this device is enclosed in a plexi-glass shell offering water resistance to a bathroom environment.
Additionally, the components for this device are very inexpensive so if it is damaged it can easily be repaired, unlike the equivalent cell phone app.
